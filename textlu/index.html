    <h2>Applying CSS to Different Parts of  HTML</h2>
<p>When you have completed a goal, don't look at it as the finish line; look at it as the starting point for your next achievement.</p>

<p>Problems exist and nothing is easy, but with strength and determination everything can be accomplished. Do not give up.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you go slowly, as long as you don't stop.</p>
