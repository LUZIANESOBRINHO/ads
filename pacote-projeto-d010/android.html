            <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But perhaps you didn't know that your friendly mascot has a very interesting name and story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>He first version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3/windows/64-bit/msi/" target="_blank" >Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was to personify the system only for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot emerges</h2>
            <p>
    
                The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission of representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.

             <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how Bugdroid, the new Android mascot, was born</p>.

             <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="">

            <p>The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> lines came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the type of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <h3>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet treat, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Bolo de copo"> Cupcake</abbr></li>
                    <li>1.6- <abbr title="Rosquinha">Donut</abbr></li>
                    <li>3.0 -  <abbr title="Bomba">Eclair</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.2 - <abbr title="Iorgute congelado">Froyo</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Biscoito de gengibre">Gingerbread</abbr></li>
                    <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Pão de mel">Honeycomb</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.0 - <abbr title="Sandwich de sorvete">Ice Cream</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.1 - <abbr title="Jujuba">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.4 - <abbr title="KitKat">KitKat</abbr></li>
                    <li>5.0 - <abbr title="Pirulito">Lolipop</abbr></li>

                    <li>7.0 - <abbr title="Torrone">Nougat</abbr></li>
                    <li>8.0 - <abbr title="Oreo">Oreo</abbr></li>
                    <li>9.0 - <abbr title="Torta">pie</abbr></li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never happened, because Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
